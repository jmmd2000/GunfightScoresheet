# GunfightScoresheet
Gunfight is a game-mode in the popular video game franchise Call of Duty, in which teams of 2 or 3 aim to kill each other before they themselves are killed. Kill the other team, win the round. Winning 6 rounds wins you the game. Me and my friend, Cameron, play this game and wanted to keep track of our stats. Originally it was done in an Excel spreadsheet and every 25 games or so I would manually calculate all kinds of data from the recorded game results. I wanted a way to automate this and also exercise my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL skills. 

The final result and can be seen at jcgunfight.com
